# ToDoList-React_Native

## OVERVIEW

Standard React Native educational project. One screens: with tasks and text input. Click on input text, type a task, click on enter and 
the task will be displayed below the text input. Click on the task again and it will deleted. 

## OBJECTIVE

This is the second project to React Native Development, delievered farily quickly (10h). Overall Im satisfied by both UI & UX

## SOME IMPROVEMENTS

- add a "done" & "delete" icon to the each task
- clicking done - the task changes color and goes at the end of the list
- clicking delete - the task is deleted from the list

## LEARNING CURVE

- Combersome to init the environment. I will probably create a Docker image, to reduce setup times.
- Libraries still create conflicts with core bundles and bundlers. Expo is up to date and updated Node to latest stable version. 
- Experimenting with Kitten UI library: had a lot of conflicts and errors in rendering. 
- Many ReactNative elements require their own packages, so again documentation it is essential in knowing what to install and when.
- Installation of Android SDK and Xcode is very time consuming and somewhat conbersome. Difficult to understand what is happening under 
the hoood.
